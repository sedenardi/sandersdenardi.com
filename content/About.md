My name is Sanders. I'm a software developer working for a small company in NYC. Sometimes I code professionally, sometimes I code for fun, sometimes I take things apart, sometimes I put them back together. Here you will find my thoughts on those subjects along with many more.

I am originally from Hampton Roads, received my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Virginia in 2010. I have worked as a software developer for a Naval contractor, a database engineer for a large financial institution, a research tool and Android developer for a business development startup, and currently a full-stack developer for a telemedicine startup here in the city.
